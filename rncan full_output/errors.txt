gnss_log_2025_02_26_09_01_38.25o | Warning : No valid approximate position RINEX header record was found. A priori position initialized using a pseudo-range only solution. gnss_log_2025_02_26_09_01_38.25o | Warning : Your dataset cannot be processed using ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR) because it only contains GLONASS data or single-frequency GPS data. No GLONASS products for ambiguity resolution are available at this time. For more information, please visit the <a href="https://webapp.csrs-scrs.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/geod/tools-outils/ppp-info.php?locale=en#v2tov3">CSRS-PPP update page</a> gnss_log_2025_02_26_09_01_38.25o | Warning : Ocean loading coefficients (OTL) not applied. To apply OTL we need either valid approximate coordinates in the RINEX header or a user-supplied OTL coefficients file. gnss_log_2025_02_26_09_01_38.25o | Warning : Although an antenna record was located in the RINEX file, no phase centre information could be found in the IGS/NGS file for your antenna. Estimated height should be used with caution. Ensure that both the antenna type and the RINEX header record "ANT # / TYPE " are valid.
