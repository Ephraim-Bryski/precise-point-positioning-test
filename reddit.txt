I'm trying to get accurate position tracking on my phone with post-processed precise point positioning. These are the steps I'm taking:

1. Use GNSSLogger to create a RINEX observation file. These are the menu options I chose: https://github.com/Ephraim-Bryski/precise-point-positioning-test/blob/master/supplementary%20photos/sensorlogger%20menu.png
2. For comparison, I used SensorLogger to collect GPS data.
3. Walked in an open area in a roughly 200 foot range for approximately an hour.
4. About a week later, I post-processed the RINEX data with Canada's RNCAN tool: https://webapp.csrs-scrs.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/geod/tools-outils/ppp.php. These are the menu options I chose: https://github.com/Ephraim-Bryski/precise-point-positioning-test/blob/master/supplementary%20photos/rncan%20processing%20menu.png
5. In under an hour, I got the output from RNCAN. It gave me warnings: https://github.com/Ephraim-Bryski/precise-point-positioning-test/blob/master/supplementary%20photos/rncan%20email%20output%20warnings.png. The output data is saved here: https://github.com/Ephraim-Bryski/precise-point-positioning-test/tree/master/rncan%20full_output
6. I plotted the GPS data and PPP data. Screenshots of the maps are saved here: https://github.com/Ephraim-Bryski/precise-point-positioning-test/tree/master/map%20images. The full code and all data is saved in the repo: https://github.com/Ephraim-Bryski/precise-point-positioning-test/tree/master

The GPS data is sometimes off by around 10 feet, but generally follows my path. However, it's very clear that the PPP data, taken in the same time period, is essentially noise; it's centered around the right location but generally off by over 100 feet. I had initially though the PPP data would be significantly better than GPS, maybe even getting under a foot error.

Looking at GNSSLogger, I think it's only getting single frequency data (I'm only seeing L1, E1, G1 etc.). Although I think this decreases accuracy and relates to the second RNCAN warning, I thought the results wouldn't be worse than real-time GPS.

In regards to the other RNCAN warnings, GNSSLooger is unable to find antenna information, and I don't see an option for getting OTL or approximate initial positions (these are the other three warnings). Regardless, I wouldn't have thought these issues would have a large effect.

My phone specs (found in the rinex file) are "motorola moto g 5G - 2024 (Android 14)".


Since I'm very surprised by the quality of the results, I wonder if there's something major I'm missing. (https://satellite-navigation.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43020-021-00042-2 and https://satellite-navigation.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43020-022-00079-x both mention sub-meter accuracy with smartphones). If not, are there ways I could improve results, and could I expect results significantly better than GPS, possibly at a different day or location, or with a different phone?
